            <p> We get this question a lot. </p>
            <p> Some people think it's a weird way to suggest a bonfire. I had one customer inform me that they thought 
                it was a cooking style. </p>   
            <p> Whatever you presumtions are, we are here to clear things up.  </p> 
            <p> Woodburning – or pyrography – is an art form that involves using a heated tool to 
                burn designs into wood surfaces. </p>
            <p> We are a company that invites people to give it try. </p>

            <h2>Why are you guys so obssesed with it?</h2>
            </br>
            <p> It all started many years ago with two single batchelors (Alex & Sam) who needed some original date ideas. </p>
            <p> They happened upon wood burning and immediatley knew they had found the date idea of their dreams... 
                Still working on finding the women of our dreams. </p>
            <p>We started small and invited our friends to come on group dates with us. As things grew we realized we should 
                share this activity with all of Provo and beyond. Thus began Scorched.</p>

                </div>

                <h4>Grab Your Things:</h4>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Any stencils you might need</li>
                    <li> A pencil</li>
                    <li> A complimentary drink</li>
                    <li> A little sample piece of wood</li>
                </ul>
           
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                For first-timers we usually suggest tracing out what you are going to make before getting started.
                We also provide little sample pieces of wood so your first burn doesn't have to on your final project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drink selection varies from event to event, but we have been known to carry all sorts of drinks from
                Sunny-D to Coke to Baja Blast to the most essential drink: water. We believe that if you are going to create your most 
                firey piece of art that you need to keep your brain hydrated.

            <br>
            <p>No rush, but once you are done you simply gather up your newly-made masterpiece and your things and count down the 
                seconds till you can come back. </p>
